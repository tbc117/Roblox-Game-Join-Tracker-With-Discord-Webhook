-- Simple "Hello World" messagebox sample
-- To run this:
-- 1. Open TLex/tlTerm/tlDatabase
-- 2. Go to 'Tools' menu, select "Execute Lua Script", and select this file
-- (This is the simplest way to run a Lua script in TLex, though there are many other ways - so e.g. to do Lua smart-styling you would not use this Tools menu, that is done elsewhere)

tMessageBox("Hello World - Welcome to Lua scripting in TLex/tlTerm/tlDatabase", "Message");
